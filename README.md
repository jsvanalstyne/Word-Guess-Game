# Hangman...Sitcom Style

Play hangman to see if you can determine the title of a popular sitcom. If you can correctly guess the sitcom title before running out of guesses, you win! Try to get them all!

## Getting Started
Once the page loads, tiles based on the number of characters in the title will appear. Your job is to guess the letters to complete the title. If you can complete the title, within 15 guesses, the theme song will play and an image from the sitcom will appear.
